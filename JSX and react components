JSX looks LIKE HTML, can contain Html, and react components, and allows to write JS code inside.

React components:-
Like functions, contain some logical code, accept arguments that control UI.
There can be 2 types of component, function type and class type, in which funtion type is as same as the JS funtion, but inclass, we have certain rules;
1) alwas import component in the code.
2) always extend the imported code in the class.
always call render function, and render function will always return some kind of UI from it.
