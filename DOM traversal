DOM traversal, is the act of selecting nodes from dom tree.
We can traverse DOM by selector method and child node properties.
Query selector method: Allows us to search and match one or more given selector method.
Some commands:-
1) document.queryselectorAll("whatever tag u want to lookzThrough");   #Store the values of this command in a variable, and thhen print the variable
2) document.queryselector(".orange").innerHTML; # use this for inner part of doc page
3) apple.List.childNodes; #for all the children of the nodes.
4) appleList.firstChild/LastChild; #for the first and last child of the tree
5) appleList.parentElement; #for the parent node of the tree
6) nextElementSibiling/ previousElementSibiling; #as the name suggest, for the previous or the next sibiling
